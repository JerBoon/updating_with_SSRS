1. Run the sql script in the database of your choice. Currently it's create a table
  in a database called [Jer] but you can change that.

2. Update the RDL file to report manager (or report server), and configure the
   connection details for where you created the table in step 1

3. Run the repoirt, click hyperlinks as you find them.


How it works
------------

The report contains 3 datasets:
  1) To update the answer of your choice according to its parameter settings,
     ONLY WHEN the value of the Action parameter = "Update"
  2) To update the entire table and set all the answers back to null,
     ONLY WHEN the value of the Action parameter = "Delete"
  3) To query the couurent contents of the table

The ordering of these is important. Or at least the fact that the query runs
after any updates/DML.

In data source properties - "Use single transaction when processing the queries"
is ticked. THis is important, to ensure that the various bits of SQL runn the
order I want them to.

The report contains 3 hidden paramaters. By default, the one which matters, and
makes it simply show the current contents of the table, Action is set to "Query".

When you click tany of the hyperlinks on the report, it executes another instance
of the same report, but passing in some different (hidden) paramaters which control
any DML actions which'll happen before it then queries back the new contents of the 
table.


When is doesn't work too well
-----------------------------

If you click the "back" button, or refresh your browser, what happens then.
